I am a Graduate Research Assistant with Photogrammetry Computer Vision Lab ([PCVlab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/))
Jianli Wei, and I will be completing my PhD program in Electrical Computer Engineering from The Ohio State University in August 2023. As , I have worked on several research projects with Ford Motor Company and Ubihere Inc, which have allowed me to put what I have learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense. I also have a patent titled ‘Systems and Methods for Hypersonic Aerial Platform Geopositioning’, which is in review now. I pride myself on being detail-oriented, creative, and hardworking.  I understand that you are searching for a Research Scientist in Machine Learning, and I believe my skillset would benefit your company’s research work in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Image Processing.

I am a Research Scientist at Meta, working on data sub-sampling algorithms for Facebook Ads. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/); my PhD research was on improving data selection efficiency with differentiable optimization layers.  During my PhD, I won the [NeurIPS 2020 education challenge](https://eedi.com/projects/neurips-education-challenge) for improving question selection efficiency in computerized adaptive tests (e.g., GRE, GMAT). During my PhD, I did two research internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I worked on optimal bidding strategy in real-time bidding systems. Before my PhD, I was a Software Engineer (Applied Scientist) at [Microsoft BingAds](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/bangalore-campus.aspx) where I had the opportunity to work on improving click performance and ad selection algorithms. Even before that, I had amazing years at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/), where I worked on robust learning under noisy labels. I have been fortunate to work with some amazing researchers and publish in many exciting machine learning/data mining conferences and workshops such as AAAI, CVPR, ICML, IJCAI, KDD, and SIAM SDM. I also received the Best Student Paper Award from the [IEEE Big Data](https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/index.html) (2020) conference.
