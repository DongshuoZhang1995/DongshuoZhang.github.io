I am a Graduate Research Assistant with [Photogrammetry Computer Vision Lab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/) under guidance of Professor [Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15). I passed PhD Candidate exam in August, 2022. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Computer Engineering Department from The Ohio State University. I have worked on several research projects with [Ford Motor Company](https://www.ford.com/) and [UbiHere Inc.](https://ubihere.com/), which have allowed me to put what I have learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense. I also have a patent titled `Systems and Methods for Hypersonic Aerial Platform Geopositioning`, which is in review now.

Before my PhD, I completed my M.S. program in Electrical Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University. Even before that, I had amazing years at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), where I worked on electric information analysis and digital signal processing.
