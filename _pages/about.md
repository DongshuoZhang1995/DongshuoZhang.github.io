Throughout my academic journey, I have served as a dedicated Graduate Research Assistant at [PCVlab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/) directed by Professor [Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15). I will complete my PhD program by December 2023. In this role, my research was funded by industry including [Ford Motor Company](https://www.ford.com/) and [Ubihere Inc.](https://ubihere.com/). These collaborations have been centered around deep learning projects, such as image segmentation, precise object height estimation from images and real-time autonomous navigation solutions for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, I have actively engaged in a variety of deep learning-related downstream tasks like Object Detection and Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, Optical Flow, and Image Registration.

Before my PhD, I completed my M.S. program in Electrical Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University. Even before that, I had amazing years at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), where I worked on electric information analysis and digital signal processing.
